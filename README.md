First task: Analyze Chip data

Second task: compare control and trial stores to see whether there are statistical differences. 

Conclussion: 

The Category Manager may want to increase the category’s performance by off-locating some Tyrrells and smaller packs of chips in discretionary space near segments where young singles and couples frequent more often to increase visibility and impulse behaviour.

The client has selected store numbers 77, 86 and 88 as trial stores and want control stores to be established stores that are operational for the entire observation period.
We would want to match trial stores to control stores that are similar to the trial store prior to the trial period of Feb 2019 in terms of :
• Monthly overall sales revenue
• Monthly number of customers
• Monthly number of transactions per customer.
We took a simple average of the correlation and magnitude scores for each driver to find the appropriate control store, as a result, the control store and the trial store will have similar performance.
