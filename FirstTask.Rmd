 Load required libraries and datasets

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
customerData <- read_csv("~/Desktop/Quantinium Virtual/QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv")
transactionData <- read_excel("~/Desktop/Quantinium Virtual/QVI_transaction_data.xlsx")
```
## Exploratory data analysis
```{r}
head(customerData)
head(transactionData)
```
Summarize the Data
```{r}
summary(customerData)
summary(transactionData)
```
```{r}
#### Convert DATE column to a date format
transactionData$DATE <- as.Date(transactionData$DATE, origin = "1899-12-30")
```
We should check that we are looking at the right products by examining PROD_NAME.
```{r}
summary(transactionData$PROD_NAME)
table(transactionData$PROD_NAME)
unique(transactionData$PROD_NAME)
```
```{r}
#### Examine the words in PROD_NAME to see if there are any incorrect entries
#### such as products that are not chips
productWords <- data.table(unlist(strsplit(unique(transactionData$PROD_NAME), " ")))
setnames(productWords, 'words')
```


As we are only interested in words that will tell us if the product is chips or
not, let's remove all words with digits and special characters such as '&' from our
set of product words. We can do this using `grepl()`

```{r}
library(stringr)
library(stringi)
# Remove digits and special characters and convert to lowercase
PROD_NAMES <- str_to_lower(str_replace_all(transactionData$PROD_NAME, "[^[:alpha:][:space:]]", ""))

```

#### Let's look at the most common words by counting the number of times a word appears and
#### sorting them by this frequency in order of highest to lowest frequency
```{r}
words <- str_split(PROD_NAMES, "\\s+")
# Convert the list of words to a vector and sort by frequency of occurrence
freq <- sort(table(unlist(words)), decreasing = TRUE)
# Display the frequency table
print(freq)
```


There are salsa products in the dataset but we are only interested in the chips
category, so let's remove these.
```{r}
# Remove rows containing the word "salsa"
transactionData <- transactionData[!grepl("salsa", tolower(transactionData$PROD_NAME)), ]
```


Next, we can use `summary()` to check summary statistics such as mean, min and max
values for each feature to see if there are any obvious outliers in the data and if
there are any nulls in any of the columns (`NA's : number of nulls` will appear in
the output if there are any nulls).
```{r}
summary(transactionData)
```
There are no nulls in the columns but product quantity appears to have an outlier
which we should investigate further. Let's investigate further the case where 200
packets of chips are bought in one transaction.

```{r}
# Subset the data frame to select the row 
row <- subset(transactionData, PROD_QTY == 200)

# Print the selected row
print(row)
```
There are two transactions where 200 packets of chips are bought in one transaction
and both of these transactions were by the same customer. 

```{r}
# Subset the data frame to select the row 
row2 <- subset(transactionData, LYLTY_CARD_NBR == 226000)
# Print the selected row
print(row2)
```
It looks like this customer has only had the two transactions over the year and is
not an ordinary retail customer. The customer might be buying chips for commercial
purposes instead. We'll remove this loyalty card number from further analysis.

```{r}
# Remove rows containing the customer 
transactionData <- transactionData[transactionData$LYLTY_CARD_NBR != 226000, ]
```

#### Re-examine transaction data
```{r}
summary(transactionData)
```
That's better. Now, let's look at the number of transaction lines over time to see
if there are any obvious data issues such as missing data.

```{r}
# Load the dplyr package
library(dplyr)
# Group the data frame by date and count the number of observations
transactionData_grouped <- transactionData %>%
  group_by(DATE) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

# Print the new data frame
print(transactionData_grouped)
```
There's only 364 rows, meaning only 364 dates which indicates a missing date. Let's
create a sequence of dates from 1 Jul 2018 to 30 Jun 2019 and use this to create a
chart of number of transactions over time to find the missing date.

```{r}
#### Create a sequence of dates and join this the count of transactions by date
dates <- seq(as.Date("2018-07-01"), as.Date("2019-06-30"), by = "day")
# Create a data frame with the sequence of dates
dates_df <- data.frame(DATE = dates)
# Merge the data frames based on the date column
transactions_by_day <- merge(dates_df, transactionData_grouped, by= "DATE", all.x = TRUE)
# Print the merged data frame
print(transactions_by_day)
```
```{r}
#### Setting plot themes to format graphs
theme_set(theme_bw())
theme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
#### Plot transactions over time
ggplot(transactions_by_day, aes(x = DATE, y = Count)) +
 geom_line() +
 labs(x = "Day", y = "Number of transactions", title = "Transactions over time") +
 scale_x_date(breaks = "1 month") +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))
```
We can see that there is an increase in purchases in December and a break in late
December. Let's zoom in on this.
#### Filter to December and look at individual days
```{r}
# Filter for dates in December only
december_data <- transactions_by_day[month(transactions_by_day$DATE) == 12, ]
print(december_data)
```
```{r}
#### Over to you - recreate the chart above zoomed in to the relevant dates.
ggplot(december_data, aes(x = DATE, y = Count)) +
 geom_line() +
 labs(x = "Day", y = "Number of transactions", title = "Transactions over December") +
 scale_x_date(breaks = "1 day") +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5))
```

We can see that the increase in sales occurs in the lead-up to Christmas and that
there are zero sales on Christmas day itself. This is due to shops being closed on
Christmas day.
Now that we are satisfied that the data no longer has outliers, we can move on to
creating other features such as brand of chips or pack size from PROD_NAME. We will
start with pack size.

```{r}
#### Pack size
#### We can work this out by taking the digits that are in PROD_NAME
# Extract numbers
transactionData$PACK_SIZE <- str_extract(transactionData$PROD_NAME, "\\d+\\.?\\d*")
# change into number column
transactionData$PACK_SIZE <- as.numeric(transactionData$PACK_SIZE)
summary(transactionData$PACK_SIZE)
```
The largest size is 380g and the smallest size is 70g - seems sensible!
```{r}
#### Let's plot a histogram of PACK_SIZE since we know that it is a categorical variable and not a continuous variable even though it is numeric.
# Over to you! Plot a histogram showing the number of transactions by pack size.
# Group the data frame by date and count the number of observations
transactionData_Pack_Size <- transactionData %>%
  group_by(PACK_SIZE) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

# Print the new data frame
print(transactionData_Pack_Size)
```

```{r}
# Over to you! Plot a histogram showing the number of transactions by pack size.
# Plot a histogram
# Create a histogram using ggplot2
transactionData_Pack_Size <- transactionData_Pack_Size[order(transactionData_Pack_Size$PACK_SIZE), ]
transactionData_Pack_Size$PACK_SIZE <- as.character(transactionData_Pack_Size$PACK_SIZE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(transactionData_Pack_Size, aes(x = PACK_SIZE, y = Count)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of PACK_SIZE", x = "PACK_SIZE", y = "Transactions")
```
Pack sizes created look reasonable.
Now to create brands, we can use the first word in PROD_NAME to work out the brand
name...

```{r}
# Load the stringr package
library(stringr)
# Extract the first word from the text_col column and create a new column called first_word
transactionData$BRAND <- word(transactionData$PROD_NAME, 1)
```

Some of the brand names look like they are of the same brands - such as RED and
RRD, which are both Red Rock Deli chips. Let's combine these together.
```{r}
# Get the unique values from the column
unique_Brands <- unique(transactionData$BRAND)

# Print the unique values
print(unique_Brands)
```
Snbts vs Sunbites
Dorito vs Doritos
 "Infzns" vs "Infuzions"
 "WW" vs "Woolworths"
 "Smith" vs "Smiths"
 Grain vs "GrnWves"
RED vs RRD

```{r}
# Use the assignment operator to change the values 
transactionData$BRAND[transactionData$BRAND == "Snbts"] <- "Sunbites"
transactionData$BRAND[transactionData$BRAND == "Dorito"] <- "Doritos"
transactionData$BRAND[transactionData$BRAND == "Infzns"] <- "Infuzions"
transactionData$BRAND[transactionData$BRAND == "WW"] <- "Woolworths"
transactionData$BRAND[transactionData$BRAND == "Red"] <- "RRD"
transactionData$BRAND[transactionData$BRAND == "Smith"] <- "Smiths"
transactionData$BRAND[transactionData$BRAND == "Grain"] <- "GrnWves"
```

#### Check again
# Over to you! Check the results look reasonable. 

```{r}
# Get the unique values from the column
unique_Brands2 <- unique(transactionData$BRAND)

# Print the unique values
print(unique_Brands2)
```

### Examining customer data
Now that we are happy with the transaction dataset, let's have a look at the
customer dataset.

```{r}
summary(customerData)
head(customerData)
```
#### Merge transaction data to customer data
```{r}
data <- merge(transactionData, customerData, all.x = TRUE)
```

Let's also check if some customers were not matched on by checking for nulls.
```{r}
# Check for null values in entire dataset
# Over to you! See if any transactions did not have a matched customer.
any(is.na(data))
```
Great, there are no nulls! So all our customers in the transaction data has been
accounted for in the customer dataset.
Note that if you are continuing with Task 2, you may want to retain this dataset
which you can write out as a csv
```{r Code to save dataset as a csv}
write.csv(data, "~/Desktop/Quantinium Virtual/QVI_data.csv")
```
Data exploration is now complete!

## Data analysis on customer segments
Now that the data is ready for analysis, we can define some metrics of interest to
the client:
- Who spends the most on chips (total sales), describing customers by lifestage and
how premium their general purchasing behaviour is
- How many customers are in each segment
- How many chips are bought per customer by segment
- What's the average chip price by customer segment
We could also ask our data team for more information. Examples are:
- The customer's total spend over the period and total spend for each transaction
to understand what proportion of their grocery spend is on chips
- Proportion of customers in each customer segment overall to compare against the
mix of customers who purchase chips
Let's start with calculating total sales by LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER and
plotting the split by these segments to describe which customer segment contribute
most to chip sales.

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.align = "center"}
#### Total sales by LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER
# Over to you! Calculate the summary of sales by those dimensions and create a plot.
Segment_Sales <- data%>%
  group_by(LIFESTAGE, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER) %>%
  summarise(Total_Sales = sum(TOT_SALES), .groups = "drop")
```

Plot the graph
```{r fig.width = 10, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(Segment_Sales, aes(x = LIFESTAGE, y = Total_Sales, fill = PREMIUM_CUSTOMER)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Total Sales by Lifestage and Premium Customer", x = "Lifestage", y = "Total Sales") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```
There are more Mainstream - young singles/couples and Mainstream - retirees who buy
chips. This contributes to there being more sales to these customer segments but
this is not a major driver for the Budget - Older families segment.
Higher sales may also be driven by more units of chips being bought per customer.
Let's have a look at this next.

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.align = "center"}
#### Average number of units per customer by LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER
# Over to you! Calculate and plot the average number of units per customer by those two dimensions.
# TOT_SALES / PROD_QTY
#### Total avg sales by LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER
Segment_QTY <- data%>%
  group_by(LIFESTAGE, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER) %>%
  summarise(Total_QTY = sum(PROD_QTY), .groups = "drop")
Segment_AVG_Sales <- merge(Segment_Sales, Segment_QTY, all.x = TRUE)
Segment_AVG_Sales$AVG_SALES <- Segment_AVG_Sales$Total_Sales / Segment_AVG_Sales$Total_QTY
```
Plot the graph
```{r fig.width = 10, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(Segment_AVG_Sales, aes(x = LIFESTAGE, y = AVG_SALES, fill = PREMIUM_CUSTOMER)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Avg Sales by Lifestage and Premium Customer", x = "Lifestage", y = "Total Sales") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```
Mainstream mid age and young singles and couples are more willing to pay more per
packet of chips compared to their budget and premium counterparts. This may be due
to premium shoppers being more likely to buy healthy snacks and when they buy
chips, this is mainly for entertainment purposes rather than their own consumption.
This is also supported by there being fewer premium mid age and young singles and
couples buying chips compared to their mainstream counterparts.
As the difference in average price per unit isn't large, we can check if this difference is statistically different.

```{r}
#### Perform an independent t-test between mainstream vs premium and budget midage and
#### young singles and couples
# Over to you! Perform a t-test to see if the difference is significant.

# mainstream budget midage and young singles and couples
# premium budget midage and young singles and couples
data$UNIT <- data$TOT_SALES / data$PROD_QTY
data_New <- subset(data, LIFESTAGE == "MIDAGE SINGLES/COUPLES" | LIFESTAGE == "YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES")
# mainstream young singles and couples vs budget young singles and couples
data_y <- subset(data_New, LIFESTAGE == "YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES")
data_y1 <- subset(data_y, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER != "Premium")
# Subset data to only include two levels of PREMIUM_CUSTOMER
data_y1 <- subset(data_y1, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER %in% c("Budget", "Mainstream"))
# Perform t-test
t.test(UNIT ~ PREMIUM_CUSTOMER, data = data_y1)
```

the unit price for mainstream,
young singles and couples ARE significantly higher than
that of budget young and singles and couples.

```{r}
# Subset data to only include two levels of PREMIUM_CUSTOMER
#  mainstream young singles and couples vs premium young singles and couples
# Subset data to only include two levels of PREMIUM_CUSTOMER
data_y2 <- subset(data_y, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER %in% c("Premium", "Mainstream"))
# Perform t-test
t.test(UNIT ~ PREMIUM_CUSTOMER, data = data_y2)
```
the unit price for mainstream,
young singles and couples ARE significantly higher than
that of Premium young and singles and couples.

```{r}
# Subset data to only include two levels of PREMIUM_CUSTOMER
#  mainstream midage singles and couples vs budget midage singles and couples
data_m <- subset(data_New, LIFESTAGE == "MIDAGE SINGLES/COUPLES")
# Subset data to only include two levels of PREMIUM_CUSTOMER
data_m1 <- subset(data_m, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER %in% c("Budget", "Mainstream"))
# Perform t-test
t.test(UNIT ~ PREMIUM_CUSTOMER, data = data_m1)
```

the unit price for mainstream,
midage singles and couples ARE significantly higher than
that of budget midage and singles and couples.

```{r}
#  mainstream midage singles and couples vs premium midage singles and couples
# Subset data to only include two levels of PREMIUM_CUSTOMER
data_m2 <- subset(data_m, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER %in% c("Premium", "Mainstream"))
# Perform t-test
t.test(UNIT ~ PREMIUM_CUSTOMER, data = data_m2)
```
the unit price for mainstream,
mid age singles and couples ARE significantly higher than
that of Premium mid age and singles and couples.

## Deep dive into specific customer segments for insights
We have found quite a few interesting insights that we can dive deeper into.
We might want to target customer segments that contribute the most to sales to
retain them or further increase sales. Let's look at Mainstream - young
singles/couples. For instance, let's find out if they tend to buy a particular
brand of chips.

```{r}
##Let's look at Mainstream - young singles/couples.
data_y3 <- subset(data_y, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER == "Mainstream")
data_summary <- data_y3 %>%
  group_by(LYLTY_CARD_NBR) %>%
  summarize(Brand_List = list(BRAND))
#data_summary <- data_y3[,c("LYLTY_CARD_NBR","BRAND")]

#data_summary <- data_y3["BRAND"]
# install and load arules package
library(arules)

# create a transactions object
trans <- as(data_summary$Brand_List, "transactions")

# explore the transactions
summary(trans)

# perform Apriori analysis
rules <- apriori(trans, parameter = list(support = 0.001, confidence = 0.5))

# explore the rules
summary(rules)
inspect(rules)
```

Let's also find out if our target segment tends to buy larger packs of chips.

```{r}
data_summary2 <- data_y3 %>%
  group_by(LYLTY_CARD_NBR) %>%
  summarize(Pack_List = list(PACK_SIZE))
#data_summary <- data_y3[,c("LYLTY_CARD_NBR","BRAND")]

#data_summary <- data_y3["BRAND"]
# install and load arules package
library(arules)

# create a transactions object
trans2 <- as(data_summary2$Pack_List, "transactions")

# explore the transactions
summary(trans2)

# perform Apriori analysis
rules2 <- apriori(trans2, parameter = list(support = 0.001, confidence = 0.5))

# explore the rules
summary(rules2)
inspect(rules2)
```
